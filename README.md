## Property Prices Data Visualization

### About
This is a quick test on visualizing price data in the Irish property market.

I got interested in this when I saw a beautifully crafted map in The Guardian which looks into the affordability of housing in the UK:

### Tools and Data sources used to build my map:

* R to process the data retrieved from the Irish Property Price Register: https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/page/ppr-home-en
* RJSONIO to create JSON output
* Mapbox.com
* Leafletjs
* A custom GeoJS file to draw and differentiate Irish counties
* Color brewer (http://colorbrewer2.org)
* Custom JS code
